### Caveats etc
Local services and tax rates are often based on service areas.  To check the local services that apply to a given property, contact the appropriate regional district treasurer or planning office.

### Preparation notes
- this data is not yet ready for publication, an average tax rate per Regional District is needed rather than a summary of all taxes applied in various service areas within the RD
