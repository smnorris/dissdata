# dissdata

Data collection for MIT's DISS application

## Usage
Browse the the `/dissdata/data` folder to see included data.  

README files in each subfolder for information about the data files included, such as:
- title
- description
- source
- caveats
- preparation notes  

Data files noted in the READMEs are all held as .csv.

A data dictionary for each data file is included in the corresponding `_METADATA.csv`, with type and description for each column included in the data file.
