## Title
BC First nations community locations, population and contact info.


## Description
The Communities data provides a range of information about Aboriginal communities in BC including type (as described above), population, contact information and geographic information.

Where possible, the different types of communities are linked together to show the political and governance relationships among them. Communities are also linked to other key economic drivers found in the database including companies owned by the community, projects affecting the community, and agreements that they have signed.

By displaying these relationships within the database, FNEDD allows for community and regional level analysis of economic indicators and trends including growth in Aboriginal business, employment and participation in major projects through established relationships with resource developers and governments.

Communities location and population data is sourced from Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC). Population data is provided only for the First Nation or Band level as made publicly available by AANDC.

## Caveats etc
Several locations are from MARR, not AANDC (primarily Yukon FNs with interests in BC)

## Preparation notes
