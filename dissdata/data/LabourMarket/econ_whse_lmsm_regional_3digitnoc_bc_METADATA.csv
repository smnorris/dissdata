occupation_characteristic,text,"The occupation charachteristic estimate reported on. Possible values include : 
1. Demand Outlook: The number of workers needed (employment) as well as the number of workers that are normally unemployed (because they are transitioning between jobs, responding to seasonal fluctuations, or their skills do not match those required by employers). May be zero for an occupation in some regions, which implies that the occupation does not exist in the region.
2. Supply Outlook: The possible labour force, including supply from new entrants and from migrants. May be zero for an occupation in some regions, which implies that the occupation does not exist in the region.
3. Supply less Demand: The difference between the Supply Outlook and Demand Outlook. If this value is positive, then Supply is greater than Demand.
4. Supply/Demand: The ratio of the Supply Outlook to the Demand Outlook. If this ratio is greater than 1, Supply is greater than Demand, suggesting an excess supply of labour. If the ratio is less than 1, Supply is less than Demand, suggesting an excess demand for labour.
5. Total Openings Outlook Openings Outlook: Estimated number of job openings over the outlook period due to expansion and replacement.
6. Expansion: New job openings that arise due to economic and industry growth. It is the difference between the Demand Outlook in 2020 and 2010.
7. Replacement: Job openings that need to be filled due to retirements and deaths.
